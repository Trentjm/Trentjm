# ✌🏽 Hello Friend

Welcome to my Github! I'm currently studying towards a Bachelor's Degree of Information Science, majoring in Compiter Science in Auckland New Zealand. Whilst my journey in Computer Science is just begining, I have always been drawn to computers and how they work. My passions in the computing field include (but is not limited to) cyber security and machine learning.

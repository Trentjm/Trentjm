# ✌🏽 Trentjm

**Software Engineering student & Locomotive Engineer**

Welcome to my Github! I'm currently studying towards a BA majoring in Software engineering in Auckland New Zealand. Whilst my journey in Software engineering is just begining, I have always been drawn to computers and how they work. My passions in the computing field include (but are not limited to) cyber security and machine learning.
